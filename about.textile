<p class="flow">Hello. My name is Terence. I work at Heroku maintaining the Ruby stack and a slew of Open Source Software projects such as "Bundler":http://gembundler.com and "Resque":http://github.com/defunkt/resque, as well as helping with the Rails Girls movement. When I'm not going to an awesome Heroku or Ruby event, I live in Austin, TX, the taco capital of America.</p>
<p class="flow">(I love Friday hugs, EVERY DAY OF THE WEEK! Feel free to give me one when you see me!)</p>
