Hi, my name is Terence Lee.  I'm a graduate from Johns Hopkins University in the field of Computer Science, class of 2007.  I currently reside in Austin, TX working for the Heroku:"http://www.heroku.com".  I spend most of my free time either "hacking":http://www.github.com/hone away in ruby, playing games on my ps3/pc, running, or spending time with my girlfriend.

This blog is mostly about my technical adventures with ruby, "heroku":http://www.heroku.com, "pivotaltracker":http://www.pivotaltracker.com, and other workflow ideas.
